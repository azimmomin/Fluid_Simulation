Platform: Linux hive7.CS.Berkeley.EDU 

Location of sourcecode: ~/final_project/ [In cs184-ae home directory]
- The name of the main file is main.cpp 
Linux hive3.CS.Berkeley.EDU
Azim Momin (cs184-ae) will submit on Linux hive3.CS.Berkeley.EDU

Compiling:
	make clean; make; ./final testPath

	- testPath is the path to the test file. This must contain certain parameters.
          See Scene.cpp for valid parameters.

Required Features:
	 - The WASD rotate object
	 - QE keys zoom in and out
	 - SHIFT + WASD keys translate
	 - ESC key will exit program.
	 - If you are not rendering to a file, press space bar to render at each
           timestep.
         - Included collisions with objects that are parsed in from OBJ file.
         - Created acceleration structures for collisions and particle neighbor
           location.
	 - Have a fluid source to add fluid particles into the scene.
         - Kernel Approximation for SPH method
         - Marching Tetrahedron method used for iso surface rendering.

Extras:

         - Gravity fields have been implemented. This requires an extra parameter input
           in the test file (see Scene.cpp).
         - OpenMP was used to speed up rendering.
         - Writing to PNG file and converting into MP4 animation.
